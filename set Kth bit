Given a number n and a value k. From the right, set the kth bit in the binary representation of n. The position of LSB(or last bit) is 0, second last bit is 1 and so on. Also, 0 <= k < x, where x is the number of bits in the binary representation of n.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int k;
    cout<<"enter the value of k: ";
    cin>>k;
    int n;
    cout<<endl<<"enter the value of n: ";
    cin>>n;
    int value = 1<<k;
    int ans = n | value;
    cout<<ans;
    
    return 0;
}
